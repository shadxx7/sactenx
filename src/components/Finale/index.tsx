          From all the stats above, we can understand that Sachin Tendulkar is a
          very consistent player which we understand from his moving average as
          the years go on. His average was always higher in all the matches
          India won and he also had gotten a higher no. of wickets in such
          matches. He also boasts a staggering 18,426 total runs in ODI and
          15,921 total runs in Test matches which is higher than any other
          player. All of this goes to prove he is an excellent player. Sachin is
          nowhere close to having the highest batting average in both ODI/Test
          which is a rather important metric. The question here at hand is
          whether he can be considered the greatest of all time for such
          questions only metrics can't prove everything as each game, each
          situation in cricket is different and require a unique kind of play
          which we can understand from the achievements of Sachin Tendulkar.
